     * First And Last Digit Sum
     * Write a method named sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number.
     * The method needs to find the first and the last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop
     * and return the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.
     * If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
     * Example input/output
     * * sumFirstAndLastDigit(252); →should return 4, the first digit is 2 and the last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the sum is 4.
     * * sumFirstAndLastDigit(257); →should return 9, the first digit is 2 and the last is 7 which gives us 2+7 and the sum is 9.
     * * sumFirstAndLastDigit(0); → should return 0, the first digit and the last digit is 0 since we only have 1 digit, which
     * gives us 0+0 and the sum is 0.
     * * sumFirstAndLastDigit(5); → should return 10, the first digit and the last digit is 5 since we only have 1 digit, which
     * gives us 5+5 and the sum is 10.
     * * sumFirstAndLastDigit(-10); → should return -1, since the parameter is negative and needs to be positive.
     * NOTE: The method sumFirstAndLastDigit needs to be defined as public static
